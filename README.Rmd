The goal of geom is to provide low-level access to the GEOS library.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("paleolimbot/geom")
```

If you can load the package, you're good to go!

```{r example}
library(geom)
```

## Example

Right now the package doesn't do much except between well-known text and well-known binary.

```{r}
(wkb <- as_geo_wkb(geo_wkt("POINT (1 0)")))
as_geo_wkt(wkb)
```
